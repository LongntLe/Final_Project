# Cohen-Sutherland algorithm

'''
Source: scivision/morecvutils

This algorithm is a line clipping algorithm, often seen in computer graphic. The algorithm will employ multiple 
data structures for fast clipping.

Algorithm summary:
The algorithm includes, excludes or partially includes the line based on whether:

- Both endpoints are in the viewport region (bitwise OR of endpoints = 00): trivial accept.
- Both endpoints share at least one non-visible region, which implies that the line does not cross the visible region. (bitwise AND of endpoints â‰  0): trivial reject.
- Both endpoints are in different regions: in case of this nontrivial situation the algorithm finds one of the two points that is outside the viewport region (there will be at least one point outside).
The intersection of the outpoint and extended viewport border is then calculated (i.e. with the parametric equation for the line), and this new point replaces the outpoint. The algorithm repeats until a trivial accept or reject occurs.

    This implements the Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm.  xmin,
    ymax, xmax and ymin denote the clipping area, into which the line
    defined by x1, y1 (start point) and x2, y2 (end point) will be
    clipped.
    If the line does not intersect with the rectangular clipping area,
    four None values will be returned as tuple. Otherwise a tuple of the
