# CS 110 Fall 2017 Final project

Author: Hoang Nguyen, Long Le

Topic: Computational geometry

# Scope
## Windowing query
Implemented by Hoang

### Introduction
Imagine that we are using Google Maps. When we move the window, we are essentially sending a query to the server to update the screen. Thus, to optimize the process time, we need to use an online algorithm, which means it will process the queries without having to load every initial data.

### Possible applications
T.B.W

## Delaunay triangulation
Implemented by Long

# FAQ with Professor
* How do we submit the final project? Do we submit altogether? Will there any change to the system?
- Remember to cover the work division
- Write a comprehensive introduction, discussion and complexity analysis
- Make sure the project is coherent and interconnected, else the work will be graded separately
* What are the criteria for high #novel-application grade? How much of a novelty is needed?
- Actually implement it and how it is used.
* What do you think about other packages?
- You can use it, but don't abuse it.
