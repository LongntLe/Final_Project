# CS 110 Fall 2017 Final project

Author: Hoang Nguyen, Long Le

Topic: Computational geometry

# Scope
## Windowing query
Implemented by Hoang

### Introduction
Imagine that we are using Google Maps. When we move the window, we are essentially sending a query to the server to update the screen. Thus, to optimize the process time, we need to use an online algorithm, which means it will process the queries without having to load every initial data.

### Operations supported
* 

### Possible applications
* Fast update of online maps.
* Improve video game experience.
